Pleeease is a Node.js application that easily process your CSS. **It combines CSS preprocessors with PostCSS plugins, like Autoprefixer, Pixrem and so on, with full sourcemaps support**. It helps create clean stylesheets, support older browsers and offers better maintainability.

In short, `Pleeease === ((Sass || LESS || Stylus) || CSS) && PostCSS`
